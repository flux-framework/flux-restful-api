# Flux RESTful API Clients

These are clients to interact with the Flux RESTFul API! We
keep them versioned alongside the Flux RESTFul API, the reason being
that we want them to be updated in sync. This also mirrors
the practice of the parent project [flux-core](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core).

 - Go (coming soon)
