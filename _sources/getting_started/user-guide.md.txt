# User Guide

Welcome to the Flux RESTful API user guide! If you come here, we are assuming
that you have a deployment available to use to interact with. If you need
to deploy your own API, see the Developer Documentation.

**under development**

For now please see our robust [examples](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-restful-api/tree/main/examples) folder! We will likely be added
more detail here if/when we release the Python client separately (and
likely will make a Go client as well).
